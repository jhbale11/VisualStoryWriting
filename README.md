# Visual Story-Writing (Legacy): Writing by Manipulating Visual Representations
<img src="demo.gif">

## [Online Demo](https://damienmasson.com/VisualStoryWriting) / [How to build](#how-to-build-and-run) / [Publication](#publication)

This system automatically **visualizes** a story (chronological events, character and their actions and movements) and allows users to **edit** the story by manipulating these visual representations. For example:
- Hover over the timeline allows reviewing the chronology of events and visualizing the movements of the characters
- Connecting two characters suggests edits to the text to reflect the new interaction
- Moving a character suggests edits to the text to reflect the new position
- Reordering the events in the timeline suggests edits to the text to reflect the new chronology

The system relies on a GPT-4o to extract the information from the text and suggest edits.


## How to build and run
The code is written in TypeScript and uses React and Vite. To build and run the code, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:
     ```
     VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


## How to use?
After setting up your Gemini API key in the `.env` file, upload a .txt file to build a comprehensive glossary with visual representations.
Note that the system was tested and developped for recent versions of **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox**.


## How to get a Gemini API key?
The new glossary builder uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for AI-powered extraction. You will need a key to make it work. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
Your key is stored securely in your local `.env` file and never uploaded anywhere. The application runs locally and sends requests directly to the Gemini API only.


## Where are the video tutorials?
From the launcher, you can start the studies to see the exact ordering and video tutorials participants went through.
Alternatively, you can go in the ``public/videos`` to review all the video tutorials.
